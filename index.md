LightGames is a set of challenges to learn programming in a fun way. The
challenges are simple [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
games, and each game has a glitch that needs fixing. You download the code,
open it in [LightTable](http://lighttable.com), run the game side-by-side with
the code, fix the issue, and win the game.

Then, if you feel adventurous, you can dive into the game's code, hack on it,
and publish your own version online, so anybody can play in their web browser.

## Getting started

1. Downoad and install [LightTable](http://lighttable.com/).

2. Download a challenge zipfile and unpack it.

3. In LightTable, click File -> Open Folder, select the challenge, and click
   "upload".

4. From the left sidebar, open "index.html", and run it: *command-enter* on
   Mac, *control-enter* on Windows and Linux.

5. To see the code and the game side by side, press *ctrl-space*, then type
   `move to new tabset` and hit *enter*.
