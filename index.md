LightGames is a set of challenges to learn programming in a fun way. The
challenges are simple [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
games, and each game has a glitch that needs fixing. You download the code,
open it in [LightTable](http://lighttable.com), run the game side-by-side with
the code, fix the issue, and win the game.

Then, if you feel adventurous, you can dive into the game's code, hack on it,
and publish your own version online, so anybody can play in their web browser.

## Getting started

1. Downoad and install [LightTable](http://lighttable.com/).

2. [Download](https://github.com/rosedu/lightgames/archive/master.zip) and
   unarchive the challenges.

3. In LightTable, click File -> Open Folder, select a challenge, and click
   "upload".

4. From the left sidebar, open `index.html` and run it: *command-enter* on Mac,
   *control-enter* on Windows and Linux.

5. To see the code and the game side by side, open `game.js`, go back to the
   browser tab, then press *ctrl-space* and type `move to new tabset` and hit
   *enter*.


## Challenges

* **game1 – Overcome gravity, or hack it!**

  The ship flies to the right but then falls into the abyss. The gravity is
  strong on this planet, what can we do about it?

* **game2 – You can move left, what about right?**

  Our engines for going left work fine, but we can't move to the right.
  Engineering, please fix this!

* **game3 – Up, up and away!**

  We found this floating box in the sky, let's go and see what's in it!


## About

LightGames was made at the [2015 EUhackathon](http://www.2015.euhackathon.eu)
by [Alex Palcuie](https://twitter.com/alexpalcuie) and [Alex
Morega](https://grep.ro) from [ROSEdu](http://www.rosedu.org/).

We're looking for teachers to help us make learning materials and try out
LightGames in the field. Drop us a message and say hello!
